A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is one of mankind‚Äôs finest tools for protecting digital privacy. You might think, ‚ÄúWhy do I even need a VPN? I don't care about privacy.‚Äù Well, that‚Äôs your biggest mistake ‚Äî you do need privacy.

Think about it:

    When you go for a shower, you close the door.

    You ask your parents for your own room.

These simple habits prove that privacy matters ‚Äî online is no different.
Why I Needed a VPN

I needed a VPN for two main reasons:

    To integrate a gluetun-compatible VPN with my ARR stack (for torrenting automation).

    To game with low latency on my hostel Wi-Fi.

Most premium VPNs support WireGuard configuration, which is exactly what I needed. Even though I had two free WireGuard configs (US and NL), they didn‚Äôt support peer-to-peer (P2P) torrenting. So, I decided to build my own.
Setup: Hosting VPN on Oracle Cloud (Free Tier)

I used Oracle Cloud Free Tier:

    1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 50GB boot volume

    10TB/month egress, capped at 450 Mbps ‚Äì more than enough.

I isolated the VPN by spinning up a dedicated VM instance using Ubuntu.
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Update the system

Always begin with:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

2. Install WireGuard Easily

Normally, WireGuard setup can be technical. But thanks to a script by Angristan, it becomes a 5-minute task.

Run:
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/wireguard-install/master/wireguard-install.sh
chmod +x wireguard-install.sh
./wireguard-install.sh
```

The script will guide you with 5‚Äì6 on-screen prompts. It auto-generates configs. You can re-run it anytime to add new users.
Don‚Äôt Forget: Open the Port

In your Oracle Cloud VNIC's default security list, open:

    UDP port 51820

    Source: 0.0.0.0/0

This allows WireGuard traffic to pass through.
Connect Your Devices

Once setup is done, you can:

    Copy the generated .conf file to your device (Windows, macOS, Linux).

    Import it into your WireGuard client.

    Or scan the QR code via the official WireGuard app (iOS/Android) for instant setup.

Final Thoughts

With your own VPN, you‚Äôre not just bypassing geo-blocks ‚Äî you‚Äôre owning your privacy, performance, and control.

    üí° Bonus: You can even route torrent traffic via this tunnel and keep your main system clean by isolating the stack.
