## 🧠 Mac Mini for Local AI? Thought About It...

Lately, I’ve seen a lot of people flexing their **Mac Mini stacks** for local AI/LLM workloads. Seemed cool, minimal, power-efficient. So I thought:

> “Why not grab a second-hand Mac Mini and connect it to my homelab? Just for local AI stuff?”

Well... turns out there’s a catch.

## 🚧 The Problem with Cheap Mac Minis

Most second-hand Mac Minis come with **8GB or 16GB of Unified Memory**, and yeah, macOS can allocate up to **75% of that to GPU compute**. But if you’re trying to run models like:

- `llama3:13b`
- `deepseek-coder:6.7b`
- `phi3:14b`

…it’s a bottleneck fast.

Unified RAM isn't magic. You hit the wall real quick with anything beyond **7B** models. That’s a dealbreaker if you're aiming for serious offline AI.

## 💡 My DIY Setup: Ryzen + RTX = Win

I looked into my existing rig and realized I’m not far off:

- 🧠 **Ryzen 5 3600**
- 🔧 Planning to add a **used RTX 3060 12GB**

That combo? Way more powerful and scalable than a Mac Mini.

With 12GB VRAM, I can comfortably run:

- `llama3:8b` with fast response times
- `phi3:14b` for long-form & document-based tasks
- `qwen2.5-coder:7b` for coding assistant stuff

All locally. No API keys. No cloud spying. No monthly fees.

## ✅ Final Verdict

| Option | Cost | Performance | Flexibility | Worth it? |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Mac Mini (8–16GB)** | 💰💰 | ❌ Lags on >7B | ❌ macOS limits | 🤷 Only if you're rich |
| **Ryzen + RTX 3060 12GB** | 💰 | ✅ Smooth on 8B–14B | ✅ Full control | 💯 All day |

## 🧠 My LLM Loadout (Running on Ollama)

Here's what I'm planning to self-host:

- `llama3:8b-instruct` – 💬 short chats, fast tasks  
- `phi3:14b` – 📄 document processing, RAG, long-context  
- `qwen2.5-coder:7b` – 💻 dev assistant, code completion

Paired with [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai), this is gonna replace **Gemini**, **Claude**, and **DeepSeek** for most use cases.

## 💬 Real Talk

If you’re **building a local AI setup**, don’t get distracted by aesthetics.  
**Mac Mini** is quiet and slick, but **Ryzen + NVIDIA** gives you raw power at a fraction of the cost.

Stay tuned for more self-hosted AI experiments. Peace ✌️
