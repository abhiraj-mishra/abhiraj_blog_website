So, I stumbled upon this god-tier cloud deal via a random YouTube short ‚Äî crazy right?

The name **Oracle** popped up and I instantly went,  
> "Okay, big tech company, definitely not a scam‚Ä¶ right?"

Still, I wasn't about to rush in. I spent the next 5 days researching everything about **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**. After all that deep dive, I pulled the trigger and activated the **Free Tier Cloud Account**.

## What's in the Free Tier?

There are two *killer* things that caught my eye:

1. `4 CPU / 24 GB RAM` Ampere A1 ARM instance üò±  
2. `2 x AMD 1 CPU / 1 GB RAM` instances

I mean, **a 4-core cloud server for free?** That‚Äôs an absolute steal. Perfect for running 24x7 services ‚Äî especially since my homelab gets shut down nightly (sleep is important, okay?).

I chose a **100GB volume**, and since 200GB total storage is free, I kept the other 100GB for the second instance later. OS of choice?  
‚Üí **Canonical Ubuntu Server 22.04 ARM**

## First Steps

When I booted it up, the system was super outdated. Ran this to fix things up:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Took a while, but worth it.

Next up, I installed **Tailscale** for secure networking and remote access.

At first, I made the instance an **exit node + subnet router**, but it kinda backfired (route conflicts). So now I‚Äôm planning to use a second AMD instance solely for VPN purposes. Smart workaround üòé

## Docker Time üê≥

Installed Docker using the official [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), and confirmed it's working:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

Then I created a `~/docker` directory to keep things clean and organized.

## Apps I Deployed

Using Docker + Portainer, I deployed:

- `duckdns` container (for dynamic DNS)
    
- `homepage` (my self-hosted dashboard)
    
- `hugo-blog` (yes, _this_ blog)
    
- `nginx-proxy-manager`
    
- `portainer` itself
    
- `uptime-kuma` (for monitoring and alerts)
    

Only opened ports `22`, `80`, and `443` ‚Äî because everything else is routed through **nginx-proxy-manager**.

In **Portainer**, I even added my homelab as a remote environment called `homelab-portainer-1`. Smooth management.![Pasted image 20250711231049.png](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250711231049.png)

Set up **Uptime Kuma** with a custom Telegram bot for real-time alerts. Works like a charm.![Pasted image 20250711231055.png](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250711231055.png)


## Blog Is Live ‚ú®

And yep ‚Äî I even deployed my Hugo blog on the Oracle instance. That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre reading right now!

## Final Thoughts

OCI Free Tier is **insanely powerful** if you use your brain and some Docker magic. From a simple blog to full-blown DevOps stack ‚Äî it just works.

Thanks for reading,  
Stay safe, stay nerdy. See you in the next one. üëã
